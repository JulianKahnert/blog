👋 Hi,

I'm Julian.
Nice to have you here! 👐

And now I should say something about me ... I guess 🤓 ... I'm interested in podcasts, music, cooking and of course programming.

Most of my projects can be found an [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianKahnert).
Currently [Swift](https://swift.org) is my first choice! 🤓

In the last years I also started using Kubernetes, Helm and some the other nice little helpers in the DevOps corner of GitHub.

In my spare time I develop [PDF Archiver](http://ios.pdf-archiver.io).
An iOS & macOS App that helps you to scan 🔎 and organize 🗃 your documents.
You can find the background story of the project in [this blogpost](https://juliankahnert.de/posts/2018-03-03--pdf-archiver/).

I would love to get in touch with you.
Whether it is feedback, some more/deeper information or critic.
Just get in touch and let me know! 🙃

You can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulianKahnert), [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Julian_Kahnert) or [Mail](mailto:mail@juliankahnert.de).
