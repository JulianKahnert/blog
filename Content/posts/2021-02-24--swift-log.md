In this blogpost I want to talk about a logging framework in Swift.

The Swift Server Work Group (SSWG) [accepted in 2019](https://swift.org/server/) the proposal of [SwiftLog](https://github.com/apple/swift-log).
Let's have a deeper look at it now. ü§ì

## How?

The `swift-log` module contains 2 parts, which we will have a look at in the next sections.
Let's first have a look at how to produce log entries.
Afterwards we dive into handling these logs and how there two parts are connected.

### Produce Logs

To get started with logging, we first need an instance of [`Logger`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L38).

We can create an instance of the `struct` by calling the [`public` initializer](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L582) like this:
```swift
import Logging

let logger = Logger(label: "TestLogger")
```

I didn't want to repeat the `Logger` creation code so I came up with a little `protocol` and this default implementation:
```swift
import Logging

public protocol Log {
    var log: Logger { get }
}

public extension Log {
    static let log: Logger {
        Logger(label: String(describing: self))
    }

    var log: Logger {
        Self.log
    }
}
```

With this `protocol` in place you can use your `Logger` in a static or entity context üöÄ:
```swift
struct ItemLoader: Log {
    static func create() -> ItemLoader {
        log.trace("Initializing ItemLoader!")
        return ItemLoader()
    }
    
    func loadItem(completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
        log.trace("Start loading items...")
    }
}
```

Now we can use our logger and add it in our codebase.
One thing you should keep in mind is, that this `Log` `protocol` uses a computed property that creates a new `Logger` instance on every call.
This wasn't an issue for me since `Logger` is a lightweight `struct` but it creates a new [`LogHandler` from the `LoggingSystem` factory](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L582) which we'll come back later.
So keep that caveat in mind if you use it on a hot code path üî•.

Since a little while I use `assertionFailure()` more and more in my codebases.
That's why I added a little extension to `Logger`.
`errorAndAssert()` and `criticalAndAssert()` are greate ways to get notified directly in debug builds of your app.
In your production code you will (only) receive an error in your logs since the `assertionFailure()` has no effect in release builds.
```swift
public extension Logger {
    func errorAndAssert(_ message: @autoclosure () -> Logger.Message,
                        metadata: @autoclosure () -> Logger.Metadata? = nil,
                        source: @autoclosure () -> String? = nil,
                        file: StaticString = #file,
                        function: StaticString = #function,
                        line: UInt = #line) {
        error(message(), metadata: metadata(), file: "\(file)", function: "\(function)", line: line)
        assertionFailure(message().description, file: file, line: line)
    }

    func criticalAndAssert(_ message: @autoclosure () -> Logger.Message,
                           metadata: @autoclosure () -> Logger.Metadata? = nil,
                           source: @autoclosure () -> String? = nil,
                           file: StaticString = #file,
                           function: StaticString = #function,
                           line: UInt = #line) {
        critical(message(), metadata: metadata(), file: "\(file)", function: "\(function)", line: line)
        assertionFailure(message().description, file: file, line: line)
    }
}
```
**One more thing: Metadata**

A good logging system should be able to handle metadata and forward it to the `LogHandler`.
`swift-log` will get you covered ü•∑üèª!
At first I was a little confused by the way the SSWG chose to handle metadata.
If you want to add some metadata to your log entries I encourage you to have a look at [these examples](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L509).
Basically, you should write your metadata like this:

```swift
log.trace("Some trace log entry.", metadata: ["value": "42"])
```

### Handle Logs

So now we know how to send logs in the *blackbox* logging system but how will they get handled?

The framework introduces a [`LogHandler`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/LogHandler.swift#L116) for this purpose.
There are already some `LogHandler` implementations mentioned in the [`swift-log` README](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) which is a great starting point for your research.

In [PDF Archiver](https://pdf-archiver.io) I use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) as a crash reporter.
Since it really helps if you get a little context of the situation the user was in, while a crash has happend, I created the [`SentryBreadcrumbLogger`](https://github.com/PDF-Archiver/PDF-Archiver/blob/bfc8cac12a3417f45302c45127020056b38568ea/ArchiveCore/Sources/ArchiveSharedConstants/Logging/SentryBreadcrumbLogger.swift#L11).
It is an implementation of the `LogHandler` `protocol`.
Essentially, it creates a `Breadcrumb` that contains all information that a entry log contains.

```swift
import Sentry

let crumb = Breadcrumb()
crumb.level = sentryLevel
crumb.category = "\(file) \(function):\(line)"
crumb.message = message.description
crumb.data = metadata?.reduce(into: [String: Any]()) { (result, metadata) in
    result[metadata.key] = metadata.value
}
crumb.timestamp = Date()
SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(crumb: crumb)
```

But how do we connect the `Logger` with one (or even more) `LogHandler` implementations?

The [`LoggingSystem`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L458) will take care of this part.
It's an `enum` that contains a `bootstrap` method which must only be called once.
Let's have a look at an example first:
```swift
LoggingSystem.bootstrap { label in
    # Factory that makes a `StreamLogHandler` to directs its output to `stdout`
    StreamLogHandler.standardOutput(label: label)
}
```
In this basic example the closure that was passed to the `bootstrap()` method defines the factory which creates a `LogHandler` when it is needed.
You can even add multiple `LogHandler`s by wrapping them in a [`MultiplexLogHandler`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L726) which is great when you want to see your logs on the console and also send them to another entity, e.g. save them as breadcrumbs.

```swift
LoggingSystem.bootstrap { label in
    let logLevel: Logger.Level = .trace
    var sysLogger = StreamLogHandler.standardOutput(label: label)
    sysLogger.logLevel = logLevel
    let sentryLogger = SentryBreadcrumbLogger(metadata: [:], logLevel: logLevel)
    return MultiplexLogHandler([sysLogger, sentryLogger])
}
```

## Why?

Ok let's recap: we know how to create a `Logger` instance and that `LoggingSystem.bootstrap()` defines a factory that returns a `LogHandler`.

You might ask yourself: *Why did you writing about a logging system?* ü§ì

Granted, this is not fancy topic but I like to learn on examples and maybe these ones are useful for someone else too.
But I also want to add the statement: **Your libraries should make use of `swift-log`!**

Your library can (or should) create internal `Logger` instances and create logs with different [log levels](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/bda2661797277399ffa66c29701659c2ba02aba4/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L543) as you think it is necessary.
If some app developer uses your library and calls the `LoggingSystem.bootstrap()` function on startup, he will get all logs in one system and can pipe them to whatever `LogHandler` is useful for him.
With `swift-log` the Swift community has a great API that can be used in different frameworks and across platforms!

### Pros

* Standardized framework that everyone can use
* Easy to implement (`LogHandler`)
* Easy to use/write log entries (`Logger`)

### Cons

* High performance paths might better use `OSLog`
* Fixed log level for all subsystems, e.g. you can't set the level to error for a third-party library you use
