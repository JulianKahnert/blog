In this blogpost I want to talk about a logging framework in Swift.

The Swift Server Work Group (SSWG) [accepted in 2019](https://swift.org/server/) the proposal of [SwiftLog](https://github.com/apple/swift-log)



Aspects:

* Structure
* Log Helper Implementation: https://github.com/PDF-Archiver/PDF-Archiver/blob/bb98069020115637836bf5ab9b0683e64cadb96d/ArchiveCore/Sources/ArchiveSharedConstants/Logging/Log.swift#L10

Pro
* standardized framework that everyone can use
* easy to implement

Cons
* High performance paths might better use oslog => no performance issues notices so far
* No type enforced metadata


Sources:

* TODO: WWDC Videos about OSLog

More frameworks should integrate swift-log
